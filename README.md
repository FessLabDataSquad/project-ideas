# project-ideas
looking for something to do?

This repo includes ideas for projects that would improve FessLab code or help manage Data('s) Squad. These would be useful learning exercises for RAs of various skill levels. Many are general ideas, but some include details. We can always talk about how to add focus to any of the general ideas.

Find something that interests you and go for it!
